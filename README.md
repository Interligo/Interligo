### Hey! :wave:

Iâ€™ve learned the basics of programming on my own and my first programming language is **Python**. Here you can make sure that I really can code something. I use every opportunity to develop myself professionally. Yes, I write all this in English in order to practice additionally :)

Now I work as a QA Automation Engineer in Ozon.Travel, so my activity in GitHub is not so high, because we use GitLab at work. I will make my pet-projects better. Soon...

### My stack of technologies:

Programming languages: Python, TypeScript.

Frameworks and other staff: Git, Bash, Docker, Prometheus, Grafana.

Databases: SQL, ORM SQLAlhemy.

Tests: Pytest, Selenium, Mocha, WebdriverIO, Allure.
