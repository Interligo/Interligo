### Hey! :wave:

I am **Interligo**, my mom calls me Ruslan, but HR-managers call me: "Hello, we have considered your candidacy, but we are not ready to offer you a work, because you do not have a technical education."

Yes, I'm a fucking master of law and I'm trying to make my dream come true.

I dropped a successful career as a lawyer for the opportunity to earn for life by not what I am good at, but by what makes me happy :)

I’ve learned the basics of programming on my own and my first programming language is **Python**. Here you can make sure that I really can code something. I use every opportunity to develop myself professionally. Yes, I write all this in English in order to practice additionally :)

I am interested in everything in programming, but so far, probably I’m good at **web-programming** mostly.

Programming languages and frameworks: Python, Django, DRF, Bash.

Databases: SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), ORM (Django ORM, SQLAlhemy)
